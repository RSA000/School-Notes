    "* A database is a hierachically organized set of tables comprised of rows and columns\n",

    "* SQL Stands for Structure Query Language and is used to query a database\n",
    "\n",
    "* MySQL is one open-source platform which you can esablish the type of relational database that SQL is most adept at working with\n",
    "    * SQLite is another, which we've actually used in CS50 since 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many installations of SQL come with a GUI tool call phpMyAdmin which can be used to execute database queries in a more user-friendly way.\n",
    "    * Used to build databases in the first place usally\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike in C, CHAR refers to a fixed-length string\n",
    "    * In most relational databses, you actually specify the fixed-length as part of the type definition. ex: CHAR(10) - Must be exactly 10 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "* VARCHAR refers to a variable-length string.\n",
    "    * VARCHARs also require you to specify the maximum possible length of a string that could be stored in that column. e.g. VARCHAR(99) - 0 - 99 characters\n",
    "\n",
