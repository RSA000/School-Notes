    "\n",
    "* The above formats are used for storage, when we use and manipulate data, we use RAM - Random Access Memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Null Pointer\n",
    "    * Simplest pointer. Points to nothing which is sometimes useful\n",
    "    * When you create and pointer but do not set it a value right away, you should always set the value of the pointer to NULL.\n",
    "    * You can check if a pointer is NULL using the equality operator (==)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another easy way to create a pointer is to simply extract the address of an existing variable. We use & to get a variables address.\n",
    "    * If x is an int-type variable, then &x is a pointer-to-int whose value is the address of x\n",
    "    * If arr is an array of doubles, then &arr[i] is a pointer-to-double whs value is the address of the ith element of arr\n",
    "        * An array's namm is acutally just a pointer to its first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of an array is actually just a pointer to the first element, that's why when we pass in an array in a function and change values, the values are changed globally\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main purpose of a pointer is to allow us to modify or see the location to where it points\n",
    "    * We do this by dereferncing the pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we a pointer-to-char called pc, then *pc is the data that lives at the memory address stored inside the variable pc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this context, \\* is known as the dereference operator\n",
    "\n",
    "* It goes to the reference and accesses the data at that memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will get a segmentation fault if we try to dereference a pointer that is NULL\n",
    "    * This is good behavior which can prevent manipulation of unknown pointers\n",
