    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "C and pretty much all programming langauges have the ability to make functions. Functions are blocks of code that are given a name and can be called multiple times within your code. Functions are useful for making your main more readable and can help when you have repetive code.\n",
    "Functions are also called **procedures**, **methods**, or **subroutines**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a black box that has 0+ inputs and produces an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int func(a, b, c)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        return (a + b + c)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "We call functions a black box because we may not know exactly how the function works but we can implement it we know what it does. For example, the stdio library has functions that allow us to print things out to the console, we may not know all the inner workings of printf but we know what it does and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to give functions obvious names and to give the enough documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why use functions?\n",
    "* To better organize your code\n",
    "* To simplify your code.\n",
    "* Reusability: functions can be used more then once in your code, making your program more DRY\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using functions in C\n",
    "* Function Declarations\n",
    "    * First you need to declare a function\n",
    "    * Function declarations should always go above your main()\n",
    "    * There is standard form that every function declaration follows: \n",
    "        * return-type name(argument-list);\n",
    "            * The return-type is what kkind of variable the function will output\n",
    "            * The name is what you want to call your function.\n",
    "            * The argument-list is the comma-separated set of inputs to your function, each which has a type and a name\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an addition function:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// adding two integers\n",
    "int add_two_ints(int a, int b);\n",
    "// multiplying two floating point numbers together\n",
    "float multiply_two_floats(float a, float b);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Function definitions\n",
    "After declaring our function, we need to actually program it's behaviour. \n",
    "    * The beginning of a function definition looks identical to a declaring a function (except the semi colon)\n",
    "\n",
    "example: \n",
    "```c\n",
    "float mult_two_reals(float x, float y)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    float product = x * y;\n",
    "    return product;\n",
    "}\n",
    "// or \n",
    "float mult_two_reals(float x, float y)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return x * y;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Function Calls\n",
    "It's easy to call functions simply type the function name with its appropriate parameters/arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "example: \n",
    "```c\n",
    "float result = multi_reals(1.0, 2.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Function Miscellany\n",
    "* Functions can sometimes take no input or return no values. If we want this behaviour, we can pass void\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void function(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    printf(\"Hello\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practice Problem: \n",
    "* Declare a function called valid_triangle that takes three real numbers representing the lengths of the three sides of a triangle as its arguments and outputs either true or false, depending on whether those three lengths are capable of making a trianlge\n",
    "    * A triangle may only have sides of positive length\n",
    "    * The sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the length of the third side\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <cs50.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int valid_triangle(int a, int b, int c);\n",
    "\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    valid_triangle(1, 3, 3)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "bool valid_triangle(int a, int b, int c)\n",
    "{\n",
    "if (a > 0 && b > 0 && c > 0)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if ((a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (c + b > a))\n",
    "    {\n",
    "    return true\n",
    "    }\n",

    "### Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope is a characteristic of a variable that defines from which function that variable can be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary scopes of variables\n",
    "* Global variables: Can be accessed by any function in the program\n",
    "* Local variables: Can only be accessed within the functions in which they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "example of a local variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int triple(int x);\n",
    "\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int result = triple(5);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int triple(int x)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return x * 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// x is local to the function triple(). No other function or main() can refer to it\n",
    "// the result is local only to main.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is declared outside of all functions, any function may refer to it\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "float global = 0.5050;\n",
    "void triple(void)\n",
    "\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    triple();\n",
    "    printf(\"%f\\n\", global);\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "void triple(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    global += 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables can be usefull but it's a good idea to be careful in cases where a function may change its value. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variable Scope\n",
    "* Usually, local variables are passed by value in function calls.\n",
    "* When a variable is passed by value, the **callee* (the function that is recieving the variable) receives a copy of the passed variable, not the variable itself\n",
    "* That means the variable in the **caller** is unchanged unless it's overwritten\n",
    "\n",
    "example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int foo = 4;\n",
    "    triple(foo);\n",
    "}\n",
    "int triplee(int x)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return x *= 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// The above will not change foo\n",
    "\n",
    "// the below will change foo\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int foo = 4;\n",
    "    foo = triple(foo);\n",
    "}\n",
    "int triple(int x)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return x *= 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrays are a very useful **data structure**\n",
    "* Arrays are used to hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations (continuguous means in the same place essentially).\n",
    "* You can think of arrays as boxes, each array is a box and there are things in the box\n",
    "* In C, the first index of an array is 0\n",
    "* Be careful, C will not stop you from going past the amount of items in your array, resulting in things like segmentation faults.\n",

    "##### Declaring an array\n",
    "example: \n",
    "\n",
    "type name[size];\n",
    "\n",
    "* The type is what kind of variable each element of the array will be.\n",
    "* The name is what you want to call your array.\n",

    "bool truthtable[3] = {false, true, true}\n",
    "\n",

    "bool truthtable[] = {false, true, true}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrays can consist of more than a single dimension. you can specifiy the size any way you want: \n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// This forms a matrix\n",
    "bool battleship[10][10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "* This would form a 10x10 grid but in reality, its just a 100-element one dimensional array\n",
    "* Multi-dimensional arrays are a great way to abstract complex representations like board games.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some important Details\n",
    "* We can treat individual elements of arrays as variables but we cannot treat entire arrays as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We cannot assign one array to another using the assignment operator\n",
    "    * We would have to loop over the original array and copy the elements element by element.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall that most variables in C are passed by value in function calls. Arrays do not follow this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrays are **passed by reference** meaning that the callee receives the actual array in memory and not a copy.\n",
