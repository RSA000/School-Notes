    "We are now transitioning to the world of the internet!\n",
    "\n",
    "Things needed to connect to the internet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* IP Address - Internet Protocal\n",
    "\n",
    "* An IP address uniquely identifies a machine\n",
    "\n",
    "* The addressing schema used by computers is known as IP addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "* At first was a unique 32 bit address\n",
    "    * 4 Clusters of 8 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* IP address looks like x.x.y.z\n",
    "    * Each of w, x, y, and z can be nonnegative value in the range [0, 255]\n",
    "    * 123.45.210.1\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are workarounds for IP addresses since we now have over 7 billion people on the planet and generally people can own multiple devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In recent years, we've been slowly phasing out this old sheme (IPv4) and replacing it with a newer sheme (IPv6) that assigns computers 128-bit addresses, instead of 32-bit addresses\n",
    "    * s:t:u:v:w:x:y:z\n",
    "    * 8 clusters of 16 bytes - 128 bits\n",
    "    * represented in hexidecimal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DHCP\n",
    "\n",
    "* Somewhere between your computer and the Internet at large exists a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, whose role is to assign IP addresses to devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prior to the widesperad promulgation of DHCP, the tast of assigning IP addresses fell to a system administrator, who would need to manually assign such addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually, you've never actually tried to visit a website by typing it's IP address into your browser\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Domain Name System (DNS) exists to help us translate IP addresses to more memorable names that are more human readable\n",
    "\n",
    "* DNS is like a big phone book with connected names and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much like there is no yellow pages of the world, there is really no DNS record of the entire internet\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather, large DNS server systems (like Google) are more like aggregators, collecting small sets of DNS information and pooling them together, updating frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* IN that way, large DNS servers are like libraries that stock many diddferent sets of local yellow page books.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DNS record sets are thus fairly decentralized\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Access Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the ways we've dealt with the IPV4 addressingn problem is to start assigning multiple people to the same IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "* The IP address is assigned to a router, whose job it is to act as a traffic cop that allows data requests from all of the devices on your local network (home, business, ect..) to be processed through a single IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern home networks consists of access points that combine a router, a modem, a switch, and other technologies together into a single device\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern business networks or large-scale wide area networks (WANs) still frequently have these as separate devices to allow the size of their network to scale more easily\n",
    "\n",
    "* The internet is really just a system of protocols"

    "* These networks know how to communicate with one another with IP\n",
    "\n",
    "* Networks are not connected to every other network\n",
    "    * With only six networks, things would already get out of hand connecting them this way. \n",
    "    * We still need each network to be able to talk to each other network though, or we end up with pieces of the network that are unable to speak to other parts of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is where routers come back into play\n",
    "\n",
    "* What if, instead of being connect to every other network, each network was connected to a limited number of routers (each of which was connected to other nearby routers), and each router had instructions built into on how to move information towards its destination?\n",
    "\n",
    "* This information might be stored in a routing table, inside of the router\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using routers, the networks are not directly connected to each other at all, and rely on routers to distribute communications\n",
    "\n",
    "* On a small scale, the configuration may be less efficient than just having direct connections\n",
    "\n",
    "* On a large scale, this configuration can dramatically reduce the costs of network infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of sending large amounts of data all at once, information is sent in packets\n",
    "\n",
    "* IP is also known as a connectionless protocol. There is not necessarily a defined path from the sender to the receiver, and vice versa\n",
    "    * This means that in response to traffic that might be \"clogging\" up one particular path through the internet, some packets can be \"re-routed\" around the traffic jam to follow the most optimal path, based on the current state of the network\n",

    "* The other thing that TCP is crcial for is guaranteeing delivery of packets, which IP alone does not do.\n",
    "\n",
    "* TCP does this by including information about how many packets the receiver should expect to get, and in what order, and transmitting that information alongside the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps of the TCP/IP process\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a program goes to send data, TCP breaks it into smaller chunks and communicates those packets to the computer's network software, adding a TCP layer onto the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* IP routes the individual packets from sender to receiver; this info is part of the IP layer surrounding the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the destiniation computer gets the packet, TCP looks at the header to see which program it belongs to; and since the routes of packets may differ, TCP also must present those packets to the destination program in the proper order\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If at any point along the way a router delivering information using the internet protocol dropped a packet, TCP would use additional information inside the headers to request that the sender pass along the extra packet so it could complete assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "* After the packets have arrived, TCP ensures they are organized in the correct order and can be reassembled into the inteded unit of data and delivered to the correct service.\n",
