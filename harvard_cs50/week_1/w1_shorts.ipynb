    "### Data Types and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming langauges like PHP, Javascript, and Python, you don't have to specify data types like int, char, or float. In C however, you do have to specify the data type in every variable you create.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Types\n",
    "* int\n",
    "    * Used to store integers\n",
    "    * Always take up 4 bytes (or 32 bits) of memory\n",
    "    * range from -2^31 to 2^31-1\n",
    "    * Unsigned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types (including ints) which can double the range of variables of that type.\n",
    "    This works by not having a bit assigned to determine positive or negative and therefore there are no negative integers and the 32 bits can be used for only positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* char\n",
    "    * used to store single characters\n",
    "    * Chars always take up 1 byte of memory (8bits).\n",
    "    * Therefore the range of possible characters is -128 to 127\n",
    "    * We map numerical values to characters like A, B, C etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "* float\n",
    "    * Is used to store real numbers or floating point numbers. ex: 10.2\n",
    "    * Always use 4 bytes of memory\n",
    "    * We have 32 bits of precision. We are limited in how precise it can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "* double\n",
    "    * Also used for storing real numbers/floating-point numbers.\n",
    "    * The difference is they take up 8 bytes of memory (or 64 bits)\n",
    "    * Adds an additional 32 bits of precision from floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* void (not a data type)\n",
    "    * Functions can have a void return type, meaning they don't return anything\n",
    "    * If a function is not supposed to return anything, we would use void as the parameter of that funtion.\n",
    "    * Essentially a placeholder for \"nothing\"\n",
