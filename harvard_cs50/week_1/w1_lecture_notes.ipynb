    "* Correctness:\n",
    "    Code needs to be correct and achieve the correct thing you want it to do\n",
    "* Design:\n",
    "    Code should be well designed. Things like DRY, breaking up code in to pieces/libraries, making code easy to interpret by other people who may view your code. \n",
    "* Style:\n",
    "    Code style is important \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Basic example of C code:\n",
