    "\n",
    "* Language services - These programs, called assemblers, compilers, and interpreters, allow you to write programs in a high-level, user-oriented language rather than the machine language of Chapter 5 and to execute these programs easily and efficiently. They often include components such as text editors and debuggers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory managers - These programs allocate memory space for programs and data and retrive this memory space when it is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information managers - These programs handle the organization, storage, and retrieval of information on mass storage devices such as hard drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, and tapes. They allow you to organize your information in an efficient hierachichal manner , using directories, folders and file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I/O Systems - These software packages allow you to easily and efficiently use the many different types of input and output devices that exist on a modern computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scheduler - This system programs keeps a list of programs ready to run on the processor, and it selects the one that will execute next. The scheduler allows you to have a number of different programs active at a single time, for instance, surfing the web while you are waiting for a file to finish printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Utilities - These collections of library routines provide a wide range of useful services either to a user or to other system routines. Text editors, online help routines, image and sound applications and control panels are example of utility routines. Sometimes these utilities are organized into collections called program libraries.\n",
