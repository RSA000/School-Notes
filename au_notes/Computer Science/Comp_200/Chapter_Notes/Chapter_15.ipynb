The interrogator can ask the entities questions and recieve their responses. The communication is carried on in some form that does not alone reveal which entity is a computer; for example, the interrogator's question could be typed on a keyboard and the respnoses printed out. If, as a result of this questioning, the interrogator is unable to determine which entity is the human and which the computer, then the computer has exhibited sufficiently human intelligence to pass the Turing test.\n",

Computer scientists create algorithms that simulate the process of having simple agens operate independently and follow each other's \"trails\" to find the most efficient routes. This algorithmic approach is called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and has been used commercially in vehicle routing, job scheduling, and sensing of biological and chemical contaminants. Research is under way to use such simple agents in telecommunications networks to avoid the complexity of a centralized control system to compute and distribute routing tables within a network. "

The reply believes that indeed a computer in a room only processing symbols could not truly understand a language because it lacks an ability to associate and learn what symbols actually relate to. The reply does not invalidate the example of a computer in a locked room but it does invalidate that a computer cannot truly understand language."
