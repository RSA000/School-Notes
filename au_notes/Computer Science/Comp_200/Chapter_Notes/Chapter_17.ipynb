    "\n",
    "1. Here are some issues that you may have noticed in the news, each of which involves the intertwining of techonology and human values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Personal privacy when surfing the Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Remixing pictures or videos found on the Web to create art.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Computing for the disabled\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Practice creating analogies--Pick three topics from the list shown. For each topic, think of an analogouos situation that does not involve computing. Make a short list of how each analogy is like the topic and how the analogy is different from the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Personal privacy when surfing the web is like going out for a drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarities:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * People could follow where you're going and where you've been. Sites can track you and share information with each other to determine you're online surfing habits\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Some publically available information about you could be used maliciously. Someone could copy your license plate and rack up parking tickets, which is similar to someone making a fake account of you and pretending to be you for malicious purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * You have some personal responsibility to keep yourself safe. If you operate a car without learning how to drive first, disaster could occur. The same idea is with surfing the web. Some online scamming techniques seem trivial to most Web users, but the techniques are still employed because people still use the web without a proper understanding of privacy/safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The main risk while driving is getting in an accident as opposed to having information stolen.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * You need a license to drive as opposed to needing nothing for a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * There's are ways to hide your online usage but its fairly hard to hide owning a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Remixing pictures or videos found on the Web to create art is like renovating a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The previous owners may have built the house but you added on additions that change the overall layout/structure making it different from the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Even subtle changes can greatly effect appearance. For example, editing a video out of context so the scene means something else is similar to changing the paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The change of the house/art is personal preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "        * You have to actually own the house to modify it unlike with digital art.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * It's somewhat difficult to steal or make an illegal copy of a house to modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Computing for the disabled is like being a translator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "    * tasked with making everything understandable and accessable for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * There are many different languages/disabilities that need to be translated/made accessable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Involves changing certain phrases/actions that may not translate well to another language or person. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Companies and websites aren't expected to accomodate every language.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Language is somewhat geographically based while disabilities are universal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Languages \n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders for computing for the disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Society\n",
    "    * A moral society\n",
    "    * A functional society\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disabled persons.\n",
    "    * Accessability\n",
    "    * Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web developers - (Web Content Accessability Guidelines)\n",
    "    * Less work\n",
    "    * Less complicated development\n",
    "    * Easy ways to implement accessability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business owners.\n",
    "    * Cheaper production\n",
    "    * More customers\n",
    "    * Public image\n",
