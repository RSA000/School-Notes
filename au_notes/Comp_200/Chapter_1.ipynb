    "---\n",
    "1. Computer Science is the study of computers:\n",
    "    * This is considered an incomplete statement. Computer science has existed before actual computers.\n",
    "    * Some of the earliest fundamental theoretical work on computer science was done in the 1920's-1940's.\n",
    "    * Before, computer science was considered to be a branch of logic and applied mathematics.\n",
    "    * Computer science wasn't considered its own field until the late 1950's/early 1960's.\n",
    "    * \"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, Biology about microscopes or Chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools. It is about how use them and what we find out when we do.\" - Micheal R. Fellows and Ian Purberry.\n",
    "---\n",
    "2. Computer Science is the study of how to write computer programs.\n",
    "    * Typically, people begin to learn about computer science by learning a programming langauge which can create misunderstanding about what computer science is. \n",
    "    * While programming is an essential skill for a computer scientists (for testing and implementing ideas) Computer science is more about the methods used to build programs rather then the actual programs themselves.\n",
    "---\n",
    " 3. Computer Science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software.\n",
    "    * Learning to use software is no more a part of computer science than drivers education is a branch of automotive engineering.\n",
    "    * A computer scientists job is specifying, designing, building and testing software paclages as well as the computers on which they run.\n",

    "A heuristic technique is an approach to solving a problem that doesn't necessarily have to be optimal or perfect.\n",

    "This technique differs from an algorithmic approach as algorithms are supposed to be efficient and accurate while the heuristic technique is more getting a \"ballpark range\".\n",

    "    3. Move to the 10's place\n",

    "This method wouldn't be completely accurate but would still give a good approximation of what the answer would be and takes less steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The DVR instruction could both be seen as ambiguous and unambiguous depending on the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example for ambiguous: The \"Enter the channel number that you want to record\" could be further broken down into detail. The instructions could go: \n",
    "        1. Look for number pad on remote\n",
    "        2. press desired you want into the number pad going left to right of the desired number.\n",
    "    The person reading could think they have to press CHAN and also input the channel number at the same time. For example, holding the CHAN button while inputting the channel number which would be incorrect.\n",
